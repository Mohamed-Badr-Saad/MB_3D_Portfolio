/**
 * --legacy-peer-deps : we should use this flag while installing packages that have peer dependencies that are not compatible with the current version of React or other libraries.
 * This flag allows us to bypass the peer dependency checks and install the packages anyway.
 * This is useful when we are working with older packages that have not been updated to support the latest versions of React or other libraries.
